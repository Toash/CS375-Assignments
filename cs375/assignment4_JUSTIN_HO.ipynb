    "\n",
    "The goal of this assignment is to run some experiments with scikit-learn on a fairly sizeable and interesting image data set. This is the MNIST data set that consists of lots of images, each having 28x28 pixels. By today's standards, this may seem relatively tiny, but only a few years ago was quite challenging computationally, and it motivated the development of several ML algorithms and models that are now state-of-the-art  solutions for much bigger data sets. \n",
    "\n",
    "The assignment is experimental. We will try to whether a combination of PCA and kNN can yield any good results for the MNIST data set. Let's see if it can be made to work on this data set. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note: There are less difficult Python parts in this assignment. You can get things done by just repeating things from the class notebooks. But your participation and interaction via Canvas is always appreciated!"
